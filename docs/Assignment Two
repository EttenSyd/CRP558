<h1> Tableau Embedded Dashboard </h1>
<p>These were created by Sydney Etten on 2/17/25.
I built these dashboards for my second assignment, this includes two maps of Iowa. These dashboards will also guide my research team through selecting Iowan Counties for water quality research. We are particularly interested in understanding where private well testing is taking place, which is why one of the dashboards includes a threshold of 100 private well tests.</p>
